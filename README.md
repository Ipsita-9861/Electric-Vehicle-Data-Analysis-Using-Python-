# Electric-Vehicle-Data-Analysis-Using-Python-
In this project, you will analyze a dataset related to electric vehicles (EVs). The dataset contains various features, including electric range, energy consumption, price, and other relevant attributes.

# Project Overview:
My goal is to conduct a thorough analysis that uncovers meaningful insights, tells a compelling story, tests hypotheses, and provides actionable recommendations based on the data.

 # Instructions:
 
 ● Use Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and any other tools you find necessary.<br />
 ● Focus on clear, structured code and explanations to guide readers through your thought process.<br />
 ● Every task requires both a coding solution and a written analysis section explaining your findings.<br />
